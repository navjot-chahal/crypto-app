## Overview

This Cryto Currency tracker app let user to search crypto-currencies listed on coingecko api. The searchbar can help in searching a currency from the listed currencies.

## Motivation

I wanted to make a project where i can apply recently learned skill to communicate with a REST API and parse the data recieved in a presentable fashion. The crypto Api by couingecko was used to retrieved latest data and displayed in proper manner.

### Key Challenges and Learnings:
I encountered and overcame the following key challenges when developing this application.
1. This project introduced me to a key library in npm called "axios", which is very essential to get data from RESTful APIs.
2. CSS, React hooks.
