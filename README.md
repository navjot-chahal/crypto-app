# Crypto-App

## Accessing Application

The app is embedded as a React Component on my website and can be accessed by visiting: [navjotchahal.com/#/projects](https://navjotchahal.com/#/projects)

## Overview

This Crypto Currency tracker app lets users search crypto-currencies listed on coingecko API. The search bar can help in searching a currency from the listed currencies.

## Motivation

I wanted to make a project where I can apply recently learned skills to communicate with a REST API and parse the data received in a presentable fashion. The crypto API by couingecko was used to retrieved the latest data and displayed in a proper manner.

### Key Challenges and Learnings:
I encountered and overcame the following key challenges when developing this application.
1. This project introduced me to a key library in npm called "Axios", which is very essential to get data from RESTful APIs.
2. CSS, React hooks.
